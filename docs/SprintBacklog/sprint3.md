# Sprint Backlog — Survey Management System

## Sprint Goal

Develop advanced MongoDB data processing features for the Survey Management System by implementing aggregation pipelines, analytical reporting, performance optimization through indexing, and final project integration. The sprint focuses on improving survey analysis, query efficiency, and system scalability.

## Sprint 3 — "Aggregation, Reporting & Optimization"

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Objective:** Implement advanced MongoDB aggregation pipelines, reporting tools, indexing strategies, and final system optimization to support efficient survey management.
